Hi Pavan,

This is Lab 1 for Kenny Chan, UID: 004769092.
Task 1: This is the github repository.
Task 2: Sample text is stored in test.txt.
Task 3: The python script is called test.py.
Task 4: The open-ended project is in the task 4 folder called video.py. Inside this folder are its dependencies, the main script itself, and the image from the script. The image shows me wearing an American flag tshirt holding a red coke bottle.
